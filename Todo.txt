Todo:


Opening menu texturing
Lua JIT api
Performance improvements
Polish saving, autosaving, and loading
Multiplayer
Pipes
Player health
Combat
Mob AI
Block models show up as entities on the ground
Pipe logic
Auto-crafting system (like in factorio)
Pink texture (from not assigned yet) initially for entity objects
Blocks not actually being destroyed after breaking until a few seconds later, when initial world gen (probably should just wait for world to load)
spawn far in the air (should spawn on the ground)
Inventory should have small outlines around items that exist, also boxes should be polishedf
Sometimes breaking animation doesn't happen still when move focus away (happened when starting, and persisted throughout play session)
Move save and quit from center of screen when you press escape so you don't click on it by default

Finished:
10/21 Sometimes breaking animation doesn't happen (happened when starting, and persisted throughout play session)
10/22 Saving thread throws exception sometimes on exit
When items drop from blocks, make them wait a moment before being picked up (feels smoother that way)


Far off:
Magic system







Skyblock: You start with a single ore, then you eventually can craft more ores out of it
