Ideas:


-Heavy things: requires 2 or more power instead of 1, but can still pass it on
-Less/no caves?
-Aquifers/underground caves would be cool
-Rivers flow from springs/mountains to lakes
-Dirt with grass should have more support than dirt without grass
-Trees have roots? Suck up water? Grow with water?



tag - mobs go chunks 1-8 like a normal world torus, you are in weird scott world, mobs in different permutations

hot or cold or wet or dry continuity


generate temperatures, then generate valid biomes in those temperatures



// digging down deeper could give you better materials for building

It would be cool to have dwarf fortress like npcs

animals should also have a trust level (so they would run away from you always once you hit them) - also a default trust level that varies
domesticating should be high enough trust levels - animals should have a base trust: if one person lowers their, it'll lower their base trust
baby inherits trust
domesticating enemies would be hard could be possible

potion effect - easier to make them trust you - or a temporary trust boost (snow white)

wild animals breed on their own - population count per chunk, new babies spawn proportional to how many adults in the region - with caps
some ecosystem - predators and depending on plants and such as well

small chance of neighboring biome (migrated), very small chance random biome (migrated very far, will probably die soon)

non-earth things?

procedural generation - edible thing, leaves shaped like, color, etc. - name would be ??? at first, then they would have to taste or something and then they'd get a name of it (or even let you name it yourself)

automation later in game would be cool - through 

more plants would be nice for early
or ranged weapons or traps



Difference between salt water (not as good for drinking) and clean water
brackish water - salty but not very salty (salinity) - extra salty lakes 


Salt water -> boil in furnace for salt - very important trade good
Eventually desalination machines
rain catcher - bucket fill up with water in rain

pumping water up hill would be nice - power with something

scythe - cutting long grass faster and harvesting crops faster (maybe also an ok weapon)

Colder biomes - staying warm might be relevant
Warmer biomes - staying cold enough might be relevent
termperature varies during the day and night




dryer biomes will have some pr of water evaporating
