Ideas:


-Heavy things: requires 2 or more power instead of 1, but can still pass it on
-Less/no caves?
-Aquifers/underground caves would be cool
-Rivers flow from springs/mountains to lakes
-Dirt with grass should have more support than dirt without grass
-Trees have roots? Suck up water? Grow with water?



tag - mobs go chunks 1-8 like a normal world torus, you are in weird scott world, mobs in different permutations

hot or cold or wet or dry continuity


generate temperatures, then generate valid biomes in those temperatures



// digging down deeper could give you better materials for building

It would be cool to have dwarf fortress like npcs

animals should also have a trust level (so they would run away from you always once you hit them) - also a default trust level that varies
domesticating should be high enough trust levels - animals should have a base trust: if one person lowers their, it'll lower their base trust
baby inherits trust
domesticating enemies would be hard could be possible

potion effect - easier to make them trust you - or a temporary trust boost (snow white)

wild animals breed on their own - population count per chunk, new babies spawn proportional to how many adults in the region - with caps
some ecosystem - predators and depending on plants and such as well

small chance of neighboring biome (migrated), very small chance random biome (migrated very far, will probably die soon)

non-earth things?

procedural generation - edible thing, leaves shaped like, color, etc. - name would be ??? at first, then they would have to taste or something and then they'd get a name of it (or even let you name it yourself)

automation later in game would be cool - through 

more plants would be nice for early
or ranged weapons or traps



Difference between salt water (not as good for drinking) and clean water
brackish water - salty but not very salty (salinity) - extra salty lakes 


Salt water -> boil in furnace for salt - very important trade good
Eventually desalination machines
rain catcher - bucket fill up with water in rain

pumping water up hill would be nice - power with something

scythe - cutting long grass faster and harvesting crops faster (maybe also an ok weapon)

Colder biomes - staying warm might be relevant
Warmer biomes - staying cold enough might be relevent
termperature varies during the day and night




dryer biomes will have some pr of water evaporating

usocial species bunnies with antenni



expand inventory space with bag you make
hide cloth or string

hide from animals
killing large animals is hard or risky

needle out of bone
string from plants or maybe animals like spiders (or some other kinda farmable animal)


sticks into a weaving device - more advanced loom devices that might take better materials later but you can make it easily from the start
cloth can be woven from sting

rocks by attacking stone with your hand, slow pr of breaking off is low with any given hit
loose rock on bank or something, higher pr to get
small pr of getting large rock - used for different things

Knives early tools : made out of bone or some types of wood or out of stone (rock on rock - but takes a while to chip rock into sharp rock but then it'll last for a while)
Axe - requires a sharpened large rock instead of rock - attach to a stick requires string
Shovel - requires a non-sharpened large rock


Workspace - get by clear off of stone surface - and then you can use/craft stuff there

Spear - stick and string
Or club if you find right wood

Sticks: get easily from shrubs and from destorying some leaf blocks
Without an axe you can't cut down a tree, then with an axe you can chop log into planks, then chop planks into sticks

Most things made from sticks would probably also have a version that can be made from bone

Clay is important towards the start - you can dig up, as long as you are in an environment that is reasonably warm and dry you can just dry them in the sun to make bricks

if you aren't in an environment like that, you can just cook them into a brick using a campfire like thing (clay on hot stone)

Then you can make a brick oven

Keeping flame alive and then using it to light other things would be high priority initially until you have a way to easily light fires
Because initially making fires is hard and a pain

Also clay for bowls and pottery -  for storing water, holding soups, etc.

Garden of some sorta right from the get go in most biomes
  can plow dirt with stick, need shovel to turn grass into dirt
  
Animals - lay eggs or stuff
- thinking still in works about what kinds of animals and plants

malnutrition would be a problem - only one source of food could be a problem - takes a relativey long time for this to happen but can be relevant - you'd need 2 or 3 different kinds of things

oil - some cooking things, some flammable things, and some macheniery
	plant sources - crushed into oil (if you can make a press - like an olive oil or vegatable oil - usually cultures have some staple oil crop)
	animal sources
	out of ground if lucky (decent natural oil seep)
	
	Oil + cloth + string + stick = torch
	
	Charcol (burned wood) + stick maybe version?


Sticky would be nice - mortar - having lots of sticky things could be good
	natural tar pits
	Various animal sources or plants
		stronger brick blocks
		for some construction things - to craft you need something sticky


Tent - cloth panels sorta like glass planes - easy start kind of shelter

Logs for some of your construction


Glass - as long as you have sand and brick oven you get it, and you can make containers for liquids and stuff, also blades for shears, decorative purposes
