Ideas:


-Heavy things: requires 2 or more power instead of 1, but can still pass it on
-Less/no caves?
-Aquifers/underground caves would be cool
-Rivers flow from springs/mountains to lakes
-Dirt with grass should have more support than dirt without grass
-Trees have roots? Suck up water? Grow with water?



tag - mobs go chunks 1-8 like a normal world torus, you are in weird scott world, mobs in different permutations

hot or cold or wet or dry continuity


generate temperatures, then generate valid biomes in those temperatures



// digging down deeper could give you better materials for building

It would be cool to have dwarf fortress like npcs

animals should also have a trust level (so they would run away from you always once you hit them) - also a default trust level that varies
domesticating should be high enough trust levels - animals should have a base trust: if one person lowers their, it'll lower their base trust
baby inherits trust
domesticating enemies would be hard could be possible

potion effect - easier to make them trust you - or a temporary trust boost (snow white)

wild animals breed on their own - population count per chunk, new babies spawn proportional to how many adults in the region - with caps
some ecosystem - predators and depending on plants and such as well

small chance of neighboring biome (migrated), very small chance random biome (migrated very far, will probably die soon)

non-earth things?

procedural generation - edible thing, leaves shaped like, color, etc. - name would be ??? at first, then they would have to taste or something and then they'd get a name of it (or even let you name it yourself)

automation later in game would be cool - through 

more plants would be nice for early
or ranged weapons or traps



Difference between salt water (not as good for drinking) and clean water
brackish water - salty but not very salty (salinity) - extra salty lakes 


Salt water -> boil in furnace for salt - very important trade good
Eventually desalination machines
rain catcher - bucket fill up with water in rain

pumping water up hill would be nice - power with something

scythe - cutting long grass faster and harvesting crops faster (maybe also an ok weapon)

Colder biomes - staying warm might be relevant
Warmer biomes - staying cold enough might be relevent
termperature varies during the day and night




dryer biomes will have some pr of water evaporating

usocial species bunnies with antenni



expand inventory space with bag you make
hide cloth or string

hide from animals
killing large animals is hard or risky

needle out of bone
string from plants or maybe animals like spiders (or some other kinda farmable animal)


sticks into a weaving device - more advanced loom devices that might take better materials later but you can make it easily from the start
cloth can be woven from sting

rocks by attacking stone with your hand, slow pr of breaking off is low with any given hit
loose rock on bank or something, higher pr to get
small pr of getting large rock - used for different things

Knives early tools : made out of bone or some types of wood or out of stone (rock on rock - but takes a while to chip rock into sharp rock but then it'll last for a while)
Axe - requires a sharpened large rock instead of rock - attach to a stick requires string
Shovel - requires a non-sharpened large rock


Workspace - get by clear off of stone surface - and then you can use/craft stuff there

Spear - stick and string
Or club if you find right wood

Sticks: get easily from shrubs and from destorying some leaf blocks
Without an axe you can't cut down a tree, then with an axe you can chop log into planks, then chop planks into sticks

Most things made from sticks would probably also have a version that can be made from bone

Clay is important towards the start - you can dig up, as long as you are in an environment that is reasonably warm and dry you can just dry them in the sun to make bricks

if you aren't in an environment like that, you can just cook them into a brick using a campfire like thing (clay on hot stone)

Then you can make a brick oven

Keeping flame alive and then using it to light other things would be high priority initially until you have a way to easily light fires
Because initially making fires is hard and a pain

Also clay for bowls and pottery -  for storing water, holding soups, etc.

Garden of some sorta right from the get go in most biomes
  can plow dirt with stick, need shovel to turn grass into dirt
  
Animals - lay eggs or stuff
- thinking still in works about what kinds of animals and plants

malnutrition would be a problem - only one source of food could be a problem - takes a relativey long time for this to happen but can be relevant - you'd need 2 or 3 different kinds of things

oil - some cooking things, some flammable things, and some macheniery
	plant sources - crushed into oil (if you can make a press - like an olive oil or vegatable oil - usually cultures have some staple oil crop)
	animal sources
	out of ground if lucky (decent natural oil seep)
	
	Oil + cloth + string + stick = torch
	
	Charcol (burned wood) + stick maybe version?


Sticky would be nice - mortar - having lots of sticky things could be good
	natural tar pits
	Various animal sources or plants
		stronger brick blocks
		for some construction things - to craft you need something sticky


Tent - cloth panels sorta like glass planes - easy start kind of shelter

Logs for some of your construction


Glass - as long as you have sand and brick oven you get it, and you can make containers for liquids and stuff, also blades for shears, decorative purposes



wolf/dog neiche - looks more like a crocodile but stands more upright - hunting or guard animal - needs meat to survive and heal damage and to breed
Might shed scales?
	If climate is too cold they can't live there, but otherwise decently large range of things - hotter to cooler to tempereate
	
hair or fur like mammals do, but have beaks and may or may not lay eggs (depends on the species - like even sharks irl some lay eggs some give live birth)
	wooly ground sloth with a beak (the niche of "beak" adapted much more readily than mouthes/teeth in this world) does well in cold, eats from trees and shrubs, like a donkey, fish up, mostly you'll see trilobyes, arthropods
	
	
Player from: give live birth to small young in larval stage (sorta like tadpoles like frogs have, no limbs, young will live in that stage and adults take care, then metamorphisis in teen stage and pupa and then hatch into arms and legs, scaly arms and scan, and teeth rather than beaks)
	
Piglike thing that has a larval stage then grows up to be a larger scaly thing with 4 legs - hide is usable for making bags and things - leather and stuff
	scales vary from individual scales to skin made of scales (snakes), these scales are more like snake skin
	can live in very hot or pretty cold climate

similar to a horse in form and ecological niche, stripy scales, larval form is (water or underground?), adult is horselike and eats grass - larval form in usually rivers and ponds, they are decent swimmers, not amazing but you can ride them in water
can run very fast to get away from predators and eat grass

Fur and beaks:
	spines like a porcupine, defensive things, attack bare handed due damage but generally docile, sheds spines so you can get them occasionally, about size of sheep, lays eggs, looks like an echidna, eags worms and bugs out of the ground (like birds do)
		Spines have lower durability than bone needles but they keep shedding them so you can get more often
		
		
Antelope looking things, CUTE, tube like hummingbirds, scamper around drinking nectar - rabbit size - so you could use hide to stitch together and you could also eat them but 



flying niche - not decided yet but might not be as relevant depending on which have eggs to eat or ride them or teach them to carry packages


fungas still in thought



? Goats and sheep irl similar thing that you can get cloth from that is more adapted to warmer climates



what animals would have fat for turning into oil? More common in colder biomomes to keep themselves warm, in hotter places most fatty animals would probably be in water maybe




combination of first person and control the whole group - we should make the species a u social species, started from a social scheme similar to real life myrcats: dominance hierarchy in the shared burrow or nest, only the domiant female gets to breed but the lower ones could breed but they squabbled over who gets to breed
- eventually a mutation happened where some of the females would become identical twins at the metamorphisis stage, have shared memories and think of themselves as same individual and decide who is the dominant one. Having two people is an advantage in choosing who is the dominant queen so that ended up becoming the queen caste and eventually they made ways to make the non-twins invertile
- eventually queen twins started specializing: one did the breeding, acts as central control, but can't really move or defend herself
   - other, genetically identical but due to genes turning on or off triggering becomes "queens champion", very strong fast individual acts to protect the queen and make the colony prosper
   - they think of themsleve as a single whole self but two parts, maintain some kind of psychic link

- queen self: making new workers or getting alerts (dwarf fortress self)
- queen champion: minecraft type self 

-- other members of species "sisters" (queens are "mothers"): worker caste are non-fertile females: different variants of "sisters": queen can modify during crysylis what type of sister they will morph into
-- males: leave the colony and find another to join - genetic health of the species requires different unrelated males to mate with queens - similar things happen in bees and ants
		smaller and good at running and hiding, tend to be adapted towards being aggreable and attractive so they can go "hey I'm a nice male let me in"
		they also might help look after the young and helping around the colony jobs - good at being diplomatic types of social roles - because being nice and aggreeable is what they adapted for so they can convince the queen to let them in
		single queen has lots of males because it keeps the genetic health of colony good
		queen would usually reject multiple males from same group to protect genetic diversity
		males and masculinity: necessary role but "leaving a colony" is a real spooky thing and yet someone has to do it, but sorta "taboo" and cultural view being complicated, but so they might not be treated as well since their raisers know they won't be sticking around forever
		males role is trangressive in a literal sense - normally "protecting the colony" is vital to culture, leaving the colony and going to another is very opposite to this, but still necessary
		males are like 1/8 (maybe even less), possibly influenced by "if times are bad (low on food) so they feel they can't support raising males right now", they might kill the males as babies because they aren't as essential and would use up food (for example)
		
		
Scaly skins, mouthes with teeth rather than beaks, four fingers and four toes, hands: two digits are opposable (thumb on each side - similar to cocatoo feet on each side) - toes: 3, one pointing backwards
height proportions similar to humans

no legs or arms or eyes in baby form
arms similar to human arms but hands that look different (two opposable thumbs and two fingers)

  for toes
  
way of walking would be closer to how birds to it, similar to image at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feet_and_legs














Water:
	stores what time it got there
		tells everyone older than them that they have n air (with a "only go to older" message)
		tells everyone younger than them that they have n air (with a "only go to younger than you" message)
