Todo:

- Redo Pathing (clean code)
- Loading bar during world gen
- Rock texture and breaking is annoying: maybe make something like an anvil?
- Better Lava texture, perhaps with lava particles?
- Fog at render dist
- Day night cycle
- Transparency for things like water
- Rivers/Biome gen preview
- More biomes
- River Wyrm
- Lua scripting
Bugs:

- Lighting bug: Place block that produces lots of light on lots of blocks that produce low amounts of light, then remove it and some of the higher light levels stay around
- Follow champion doesn't keep following: once reached it stops
- Pathing makes game lag
- Multiple threads for rendering makes redstone stometimes not be connected
- Can fall very fast in lava and water: should probably clamp max fall speed
- When in lava and water, should make "in water" effects














Ideas:


-Heavy things: requires 2 or more power instead of 1, but can still pass it on
-Less/no caves?
-Aquifers/underground caves would be cool
-Rivers flow from springs/mountains to lakes
-Dirt with grass should have more support than dirt without grass
-Trees have roots? Suck up water? Grow with water?



tag - mobs go chunks 1-8 like a normal world torus, you are in weird scott world, mobs in different permutations

hot or cold or wet or dry continuity


generate temperatures, then generate valid biomes in those temperatures



// digging down deeper could give you better materials for building

It would be cool to have dwarf fortress like npcs

animals should also have a trust level (so they would run away from you always once you hit them) - also a default trust level that varies
domesticating should be high enough trust levels - animals should have a base trust: if one person lowers their, it'll lower their base trust
baby inherits trust
domesticating enemies would be hard could be possible

potion effect - easier to make them trust you - or a temporary trust boost (snow white)

wild animals breed on their own - population count per chunk, new babies spawn proportional to how many adults in the region - with caps
some ecosystem - predators and depending on plants and such as well

small chance of neighboring biome (migrated), very small chance random biome (migrated very far, will probably die soon)

non-earth things?

procedural generation - edible thing, leaves shaped like, color, etc. - name would be ??? at first, then they would have to taste or something and then they'd get a name of it (or even let you name it yourself)

automation later in game would be cool - through 

more plants would be nice for early
or ranged weapons or traps



Difference between salt water (not as good for drinking) and clean water
brackish water - salty but not very salty (salinity) - extra salty lakes 


Salt water -> boil in furnace for salt - very important trade good
Eventually desalination machines
rain catcher - bucket fill up with water in rain

pumping water up hill would be nice - power with something

scythe - cutting long grass faster and harvesting crops faster (maybe also an ok weapon)

Colder biomes - staying warm might be relevant
Warmer biomes - staying cold enough might be relevent
termperature varies during the day and night




dryer biomes will have some pr of water evaporating

usocial species bunnies with antenni



expand inventory space with bag you make
hide cloth or string

hide from animals
killing large animals is hard or risky

needle out of bone
string from plants or maybe animals like spiders (or some other kinda farmable animal)


sticks into a weaving device - more advanced loom devices that might take better materials later but you can make it easily from the start
cloth can be woven from sting

rocks by attacking stone with your hand, slow pr of breaking off is low with any given hit
loose rock on bank or something, higher pr to get
small pr of getting large rock - used for different things

Knives early tools : made out of bone or some types of wood or out of stone (rock on rock - but takes a while to chip rock into sharp rock but then it'll last for a while)
Axe - requires a sharpened large rock instead of rock - attach to a stick requires string
Shovel - requires a non-sharpened large rock


Workspace - get by clear off of stone surface - and then you can use/craft stuff there

Spear - stick and string
Or club if you find right wood

Sticks: get easily from shrubs and from destorying some leaf blocks
Without an axe you can't cut down a tree, then with an axe you can chop log into planks, then chop planks into sticks

Most things made from sticks would probably also have a version that can be made from bone

Clay is important towards the start - you can dig up, as long as you are in an environment that is reasonably warm and dry you can just dry them in the sun to make bricks

if you aren't in an environment like that, you can just cook them into a brick using a campfire like thing (clay on hot stone)

Then you can make a brick oven

Keeping flame alive and then using it to light other things would be high priority initially until you have a way to easily light fires
Because initially making fires is hard and a pain

Also clay for bowls and pottery -  for storing water, holding soups, etc.

Garden of some sorta right from the get go in most biomes
  can plow dirt with stick, need shovel to turn grass into dirt
  
Animals - lay eggs or stuff
- thinking still in works about what kinds of animals and plants

malnutrition would be a problem - only one source of food could be a problem - takes a relativey long time for this to happen but can be relevant - you'd need 2 or 3 different kinds of things

oil - some cooking things, some flammable things, and some macheniery
	plant sources - crushed into oil (if you can make a press - like an olive oil or vegatable oil - usually cultures have some staple oil crop)
	animal sources
	out of ground if lucky (decent natural oil seep)
	
	Oil + cloth + string + stick = torch
	
	Charcol (burned wood) + stick maybe version?


Sticky would be nice - mortar - having lots of sticky things could be good
	natural tar pits
	Various animal sources or plants
		stronger brick blocks
		for some construction things - to craft you need something sticky


Tent - cloth panels sorta like glass planes - easy start kind of shelter

Logs for some of your construction


Glass - as long as you have sand and brick oven you get it, and you can make containers for liquids and stuff, also blades for shears, decorative purposes




	
hair or fur like mammals do, but have beaks and may or may not lay eggs (depends on the species - like even sharks irl some lay eggs some give live birth)
	wooly ground sloth with a beak (the niche of "beak" adapted much more readily than mouthes/teeth in this world) does well in cold, eats from trees and shrubs, like a donkey, fish up, mostly you'll see trilobyes, arthropods
	
	
Player from: give live birth to small young in larval stage (sorta like tadpoles like frogs have, no limbs, young will live in that stage and adults take care, then metamorphisis in teen stage and pupa and then hatch into arms and legs, scaly arms and scan, and teeth rather than beaks)
	





		
		



flying niche - not decided yet but might not be as relevant depending on which have eggs to eat or ride them or teach them to carry packages


fungas still in thought



? Goats and sheep irl similar thing that you can get cloth from that is more adapted to warmer climates



what animals would have fat for turning into oil? More common in colder biomomes to keep themselves warm, in hotter places most fatty animals would probably be in water maybe




combination of first person and control the whole group - we should make the species a u social species, started from a social scheme similar to real life myrcats: dominance hierarchy in the shared burrow or nest, only the domiant female gets to breed but the lower ones could breed but they squabbled over who gets to breed
- eventually a mutation happened where some of the females would become identical twins at the metamorphisis stage, have shared memories and think of themselves as same individual and decide who is the dominant one. Having two people is an advantage in choosing who is the dominant queen so that ended up becoming the queen caste and eventually they made ways to make the non-twins invertile
- eventually queen twins started specializing: one did the breeding, acts as central control, but can't really move or defend herself
   - other, genetically identical but due to genes turning on or off triggering becomes "queens champion", very strong fast individual acts to protect the queen and make the colony prosper
   - they think of themsleve as a single whole self but two parts, maintain some kind of psychic link

- queen self: making new workers or getting alerts (dwarf fortress self)
- queen champion: minecraft type self 

-- other members of species "sisters" (queens are "mothers"): worker caste are non-fertile females: different variants of "sisters": queen can modify during crysylis what type of sister they will morph into
-- males: leave the colony and find another to join - genetic health of the species requires different unrelated males to mate with queens - similar things happen in bees and ants
		smaller and good at running and hiding, tend to be adapted towards being aggreable and attractive so they can go "hey I'm a nice male let me in"
		they also might help look after the young and helping around the colony jobs - good at being diplomatic types of social roles - because being nice and aggreeable is what they adapted for so they can convince the queen to let them in
		single queen has lots of males because it keeps the genetic health of colony good
		queen would usually reject multiple males from same group to protect genetic diversity
		males and masculinity: necessary role but "leaving a colony" is a real spooky thing and yet someone has to do it, but sorta "taboo" and cultural view being complicated, but so they might not be treated as well since their raisers know they won't be sticking around forever
		males role is trangressive in a literal sense - normally "protecting the colony" is vital to culture, leaving the colony and going to another is very opposite to this, but still necessary
		males are like 1/8 (maybe even less), possibly influenced by "if times are bad (low on food) so they feel they can't support raising males right now", they might kill the males as babies because they aren't as essential and would use up food (for example)
		
		
Scaly skins, mouthes with teeth rather than beaks, four fingers and four toes, hands: two digits are opposable (thumb on each side - similar to cocatoo feet on each side) - toes: 3, one pointing backwards
height proportions similar to humans

no legs or arms or eyes in baby form
arms similar to human arms but hands that look different (two opposable thumbs and two fingers)

way of walking would be closer to how birds to it, similar to image at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feet_and_legs














Water:
	stores what time it got there
		tells everyone older than them that they have n air (with a "only go to older" message)
		tells everyone younger than them that they have n air (with a "only go to younger than you" message)
	
	
warm, has rivers, lowlands 
lowlands, by lake, just dry enough that there is not thick forest but just sparse trees so it is easy enough to ride a horse through, lots of grass space, plants that grow very large flowers that the tiny antelopes drink nectar from (the antelopes are the pollenators)
rivers flow these biomes for main source of water, not much rainfall, probably some plants in the water at the river
What is going to be spicy?
	oil is somewhat limited - main good source of oil is: once they've been pollinated they'll form a seed about the side of a coconut, then launches it into the air and wherever it lands if it lands good it forms a new flower, form seeds slowly
		seeds will hurt if they hit you, but they are oily seeds that you can get oil from, just can be inconvenent to farm
		one reason antelopes get starteled and speedy is to dodge seeds - some way to tell when they are right about to launch, you can try to pry it out before it launches but then it might just hit you in the face
		fairly warm, nice rivers for water, fairly hospitable in that stuff that you need is there
		sparse large trees have bark that you can make into string: 
			main predator: river wyrm
				it has a body shaped kind of like a chineese dragon, jaws that open sideways, ambush predators, hide in plants, 3-4 blocks long, bendy, vulerable when out of water cause they can't walk that fast, they might go between bodies of water but usually only at night
				these make the rivers spicy but you need water
		tree bark can be turned into string but you need to soak it (like how you make linen out of flax)
		clay available under top few layers of dirt
		clay on the surface along the river banks
		
		spookers wait until someone is right next to water and then drag you in and drown you
		
	food sources - eventually you can get seeds into wheats but that might take time and effort to get it dometicated right
		easiest thing from the start is the smaller flowers that have bulbs like tulips or segolillies that you can eat, the grow back fast, but each bulb doesn't restore a lot of hunger
		You can also plant the bulbs to grow more
			spread vs break to get more than one - not sure yet but something like that
			also if you live on only that malnutrition can eventually become a problem
		
		calorie dense things: most animals are either speedy or well defended due to the local spookers
			fishing for trilobite or arthipods can be good but the rivers are spookers
			
			
		launched seeds can also be eaten but you might have to break them open with a rock first (like a coconut)
			
			
	large grazing animal:
		fairly large, usable in an ox sort of way (pull a cart or something), a really big armadillo, with plates
	
	you also might see the horse one (larval form in rivers but small enough that not worth the wyrm's food but still get nommed sometimes so they are not the most common) and the skeep sized porkupine things
	river wyrm usually eats the little antelope things and sometimes manages to kill younger armadillo grazer things (harder time with an adult because so armored), they generally avoid the porcupine sheep unless necessary
	they will also eat the player species
	piglike things would not be here as much because not very much defenses so they'd probably get nommed, they are more likely in the forest but might wander in occasionally
	
	maybe a few wolf/dog ones, might go after small prey like the size of antelope, working together they might go for the horse things or the juvenile armadillo things
	
	
	
	you might see slightly different color morphs in different biomes for some that show up in lots of biomes (like bunnies in minecraft)
	
	maybe some shrubbry with berries, not sure, but this should be enough to feel like an ecosystem
	

	
All animals:	
- River wyrm
- Player species
- Porcupine sheep: Fur and beakss, spines like a porcupine, defensive things, attack bare handed due damage but generally docile, sheds spines so you can get them occasionally, about size of sheep, lays eggs, looks like an echidna, eags worms and bugs out of the ground (like birds do)
		Spines have lower durability than bone needles but they keep shedding them so you can get more often
- Piglike thing that has a larval stage then grows up to be a larger scaly thing with 4 legs - hide is usable for making bags and things - leather and stuff
	[scales in all animals on earth vary from individual scales to skin made of scales (snakes), these scales are more like snake skin]
	can live in very hot or pretty cold climate
- Antelope looking things, CUTE, tube like hummingbirds, scamper around drinking nectar - rabbit size - so you could use hide to stitch together and you could also eat them but 
- wolf/dog neiche - looks more like a crocodile but stands more upright - hunting or guard animal - needs meat to survive and heal damage and to breed
	Might shed scales?
		If climate is too cold they can't live there, but otherwise decently large range of things - hotter to cooler to tempereate
- wooly ground sloth with a beak (the niche of "beak" adapted much more readily than mouthes/teeth in this world) does well in cold, eats from trees and shrubs, like a donkey
- if you fish you'll mostly see trilobyes type things (or other arthropod type things)
- similar to a horse in form and ecological niche, stripy scales, larval form is (water or underground?), adult is horselike and eats grass - larval form in usually rivers and ponds, they are decent swimmers, not amazing but you can ride them in water
		can run very fast to get away from predators and eat grass
- large grazing animal: fairly large, usable in an ox sort of way (pull a cart or something), a really big armadillo, with plates, burrows to make larva (worm kinda sense), stubby legs, sorta takes care of it until it metamorphisis to have small stubby legs at first, then it can walk around, parents chew up grass and then regurgitate for babies
	quite useful to domesticate because fairly strong, [pull their neck in, put their face to the ground], with juveniles they might try to make a circle around the babies, and protect babies by sitting on them
	animals will eventually give up killing them because its a waste of energy, they might keep scratch at it for a bit but then go and chase something easier
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

Stamina Meter: For jumping and sprinting and stuff
	antelopes run away, predators strategy is to chase long enough that they can wear them out
	varies based on the species, might also be genetic thing
Hunger meter: low hunger means stamina doesn't replenish as fast
	drains if they expend lots of stamina
Injury and dehydration: reduce the stamina cap

Stand animation: no stamina
Walk: very little stamina: as long as a creature has enough food it can basically walk forever without needing to stop and rest
Jump: take more stamina
Sprint: take more stamina

It makes sense that if an animal sees a food that they can eat that they'll actually eat it
	they'll just have a list of kinds of foods they are willing to eat and they'll pick it up on the ground

When two animals of the same species are in the same range they might approach each other to socialize, then tend to walk away from each other after a while to prevent clumping
	butt heads: antlers
	sniff each other
	tilt heads at each other
	etc.

Genetic traits: personality stuff
	weighted probabilities: if there is food or something scary, are they are more likely to go after scary thing or get food, how more likely are they to socialize, etc.
	- Likely to run away from players or other spookers
	- Socalize with same species
	- Socialize with other species
	- Run away or fight back
		crocadog will be more likely to fight back if more crocadogs around because they like to fight in packs
	- How distractable they are by something like looking for food

		
General things:
	- Standing around
	- Running away from spooker
	- Fighting someone
	- Socalize
		- aggressiveness: butt heads vs sniff sniff with same species, for example
	- Eating food
	- Searching for food
		- Chasing something if looking for prey
			- If they see an animal, look at it, then decide to chase after
				- if it takes too long, they might give up
				- walk up to something and then start sprinting
				- close enough they might start doing their rawr rawr thing and with mouthes to attack
		- Some preferred pray: crocodogs might target small things like antelopes but if a group they might go after something larger
			- They would probably go after something easier to get (piglike) vs spikey sheep
			- Some personality variation into how willing they are to go after something that is a little bit too spicy


			
	- Laziness: whether they might stand around if nothing to do or wander around looking for something to do (if full and high on stamina)
		most active might run around even when they don't need to - means they get places to find things to do faster but if they can't successfully find things to do it costs them
	
	- Sound files for different kinds of benavhiors
		- socialize
		- hunting
		- injured: hurt noises
		- very hungry noises
			might have change in animation if they are very hungry or hurt, maybe hold head lower or ears droop down, vs plenty to eat and not hurt then ears up right and socializing
		- crocodogs might run away or look at you or really friendly ones might go sniff sniff at you, tilt their head at you "huh who are you" when first see if friendy

			
	- Risk averse: how lightly they are willing to jump off a large ledge that might get them stuck or take fall damage
			
			
			
Crocodog: breeding behaviors



Crocodogs and stuff have males and females
	When males are ready to breed, they will make a pile of sticks and mulch, then sing a "hey ladies" song, then nearby lady crocodogs will come and check out burrow and see if the male and the borrow is good enough for them
			Male's decision to dig a burrow can depend on:
				how many females they have seen recently
				how many burrows they have seen recently (if they see a lot they are less likely to dig one themselves)
				If they have a burrow, they are more likely to be aggressive to males and more likely to be friendly to females
		if so they will go in the burrow and breed and take care of babies/bring food to them
		if not the male will walk off
		
Mammals with beaks are hemaphoridites

cunningham in grak's scottish ancestry
	
	
	
antelopes: walk is similar to crocodogs
	run is all legs at once boing boing boing thing like gazelles do
	
	
	
	
	
	
Jungle: rocks are mostly hard to find because buried by roots and biomass, and trees/roots move slightly so they could burrow you
	mud might flow to get clay but you'd need to dry it out
	Lots of food and plants
	
Template crafting table: put materials there for what it is supposed to craft, then it'll bring it (worker or machinery) and as soon as template is filled out it'll craft it
	also we could put stuff that doesn't have crafting result, then they need that many things to move to next step
	
	
	
initially queen moves around same as champion
	after first mult, then you get menus and she sits down and you can manage new workers and stuff that way
		you can tab between being champion and being queen
		
		
starting out:
	option: modes, one you start out with a colony, easier modes
	or for whatever reason you don't have a colony (maybe they had a disease so they had to send you away to protect you)
		then you will just be the champion and the mother
		you will also have crysylises that take a little while to hatch into workers (you don't have very much control over their genomes and they are fairly default)
		you also have lots of larval ones in statis so they aren't growing and don't need food but once you wake them up then they'll start growing
		you don't manage their genome directly: but you can control in two stages:
			- before they are born (getting their genes shuffled right)
			- before/just as they go into their crysylis: then you can activate and deactivate some genes to make them X type of worker or Y type of worker or etc.
		eventually you can aquire some males that you can start birthing to control geneomes as well
		you can control how long it takes to hatch from crysylis (roughtly) so you can postpone them if you don't have enough food
		you can wait for waking up larva because larva needs lots of food, but the longer you wait to wake up larva the more likely they might be to die when you wake them up
			actually instead, some larva slowly die in statis (think of this as "you know if they can wake up or not") so the player can see them dying off in stasis over time
			
			The mother has a larva manager and a crysylis manager
			the larva can go under statis in stressful abnormal circumstances but normally it isn't what they do
	how do you get males?
		the number of males in the area depends on how highly populated of your species is in the area, if crowded then lots of males, if not crowded then fewer males to chose from (males are more likely if your population is high)
			gender is determined when they are born: not something you can control directly, but there is a gene that can change it from like 1/8 to 1/16 or something but you don't have strict control over how many are males, you can just increase the pr
	
	
	there will be some of your species in most given areas, just to ensure you can get some males (since males will wander out of hives in search for finding a queen), then you can decide based on smell when you find one the jist of what genes they've got (do they have some attributes you want, a possibility of some genes you dont' want then you might not accept them, etc.)
	you can also have additional info about this later: because genes of males around depends on the other colonies, so once you have done some of the diplomacy stuff around so you know what they other colonies are around then you might be able to determine more from the smell
	
	
	
	
	queens can live for quite a while, but eventually they will die of old age.
		but this is very long way down the road in terms of time of the game
		so if you want to birth a new queen and "move into it's body" then that'll be your new queen which gives you some control over your genome
	
	
	initially you can toggle between controlling one champion and one queen at a time, but a higher tech thing (a "improve mental powers") could let you have a combined interface to work with multiple colonies at a time
	
	
	
	
	if you are in a spicy place with not very many males, you could steal a male from another colony but that might make them mad at you
		alternatively with diplomacy with other colonies you can trade males with thems (arranged marriages things)
		this lets you influence other colonies gene pools slightly by sending them males
			you might have slightly less control over males than female workers
			you control queen directly, workers while slightly indirectly, they still do what you want them to
			males have a little more of a mind of their own, so life if the conditions aren't very good at your colony (you aren't treating the males very well) then they might try to run away
			
			
	males should generally be smaller than female workers but more colorful because its a "hey look at me please let me in so I don't die out here in the wildnerness"
	
	
	everything is a tradeoff on some level but as you progress and find better genes that might result in better tradeoffs in some ways and you have some options so that you can specialize better in some ways
	
	
	
	
	Intelligence for workers:
		1: (in the works): there are more options for what you can have that worker be doing, better automation of the processes of your colony by having more things that the workers can do
		2: has a cost in terms of energy (larger brain takes more energy/food)
		3: morale number: the range of values that it can take depends on their intelligence [-intelligence*constant, intelligence*constant]
		
		
	Morale:
		Happy workers might give bonuses
		Sad workers might have harms
		
		
		Basic things:
			enough food?
			enough space?
			(other quality of living things?)
			higher intelligence: how much they like their job - so if you have them assigned to the jobs they like they'll have higher morale or ones they don't like they'll have lower morale
		
		for males: morale matters for if they are likely to try and run away - you can prevent that by boxing them in or whatever but then they can't do as much to help if they are boxed in
		
		
		if morale is low, higher probabilty of squabbles between the workers/they aren't as good as working with each other
			or they might just forget about what you told them to do, or take longer (do something else first, or just be slow about it because they are sad)
			
		
        
        
        
        
        

        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
What the interace/play is like:


game starts when the player character emerges from their crysylis into their adult form (0th adult molt - when you go through a molt that lets you adjust abilities somewhat, it's like leveling up)
    at this stage the mother and champion are still mostly the same
    some button to toggle between their two povs
    same walking speed
    champion has faster sprint and much more stamina
    in addition to breaking blocks and crafting and stuff, mother self has:
        - Speed up and/or slow down cacoons in processes
            - Start with 4 cacoons, all of which are a couple of days out, varying amounts of progress along
                - Takes time to cast the spell to speed them up or slow them down
            - Have an action queue in the programming; being able to say to whatever: do this, then do this, then do this, etc., maybe being able to add a thing of high priority, etc.
            - For example, you could get mother self safe, get out 4 crysylises for 4 workers, hasten hasten hasten hasten, then mother self would do the time to cast on 1, 2, 3, 4 automatically
            - Mother self has menu with different tabs:
                can queue things there, categories for variants and workers and soldiours and stuff later on to access quickly
        - Restore: increase target's health and stamina regenation at a time at the cost of your own (reduces your own generation to basically none, but then can as much as double someone else)
            - potential targets are champion or workers
            - initially needs touch, but lasts a while (similar to starcraft boost thing]), upgrades can make it last longer and stuff
        - Summon any adult sisters:
            - Whatever they are doing they will stop and come back to the mother
            - If they can't get to the mother, they might ping and say ("I'm having trouble getting to you or I'm hurt" or something like that)
            - Maybe a later ability is to tell what direction are they in
            - Maybe later you could even switch and look from their pov but that would be more mid game
            - Or even minimap essentially, later on
        - Ancestral memory: access gameplay tips and tutorial stuff
            - gives you little strategy notes that'll tell you things and give you vauge hints about strategic things
            - tutorial: tech tree of ingredients, how to get them, once you get them the things you an craft, etc.
            
    champion doesn't have any major abilities, just is better at doing stuff
        - 
            
        





sisters, 4 basic options:
    - stay with the mother/be at home
        - eat food if hungry
        - sociaize with other sisters/mother/champion 
            - sitting next to each other and particle effects for being happier because they are socializing
            - if you are nearby they might come up to you and make little particle effects because they are happy to interact with you, etc.
            - morale is impacted: if they don't have very much time to socialize with other sisters or the player that can hurt their morale
        - sleep if they are tired
        - wander around where they consider base a little bit doing their thing
        
        - wherever the mother is they'll think of as home base
        - if any risk to the mother they'll hurry to defend
        - if the mother is hungry they'll bring them food from the food pile
    - stay with the champion (try to help out with whatever, if you get attacked they'll help attack, if you are foraging they'll also forage, etc.)
        - if they are staying with the champion they might also give the champion food
    - go foraging
        - right click the button for slight variations (stay close and come back often vs make sure you find stuff vs include hunting small animals vs just gather plants and change settings and then do command),
        - they will act on whatever the settings are when you give the command
        - either give them specific items they are looking for or "find useful stuff" (ai might not be that great but they'd try)
        - if they find themselves in danger?
            - they would probably evaluate how spicy: if they feel like they can handle it (weapon can help quite a bit with that) then they might just fight back
                - might also call for help
                - if they can't handle it or if their health fell too low then they'd just retreat and go home
                - personality variations here - when you are doing adaptions later in genes you can adjust these like that
        - they have their own small inventory and can also have a pile of stuff at home base
        - or even like forage into this chest (or designate chest as: items in the food category
            - few general categories you can mark chests and/or storage things as:
                - if multiple chests of the same category, they'll put stuff in the chest with stacks already existing of that item (if relevant)
        - they'll come back during the night and sleep (or there is a setting to keep watch during the night so they wouldn't just go to sleep)
            - they'll also nap during the day if they were staying at home
            
                
    - keep watch ("sit")
        - stay wherever they are, on the lookout for spookers, if they see something of hazardous or of interest then they'll say "hey I saw something interesting" and give you a ping about it

        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
plowing a patch of dirt can be done with a stick, fairly slow and energy intensive, only works on a subset of dirt (dirt vs corse dirt kind of thing, only works on the nicer dirt, some chance that the stick breaks by hitting a rock. If that happens you get a rock but the stick is gone)


plow:
    - 1 large sharp stone
    - 4 sticks
    - faster, doesn't cost as much energy, can do even as not as nice soils, will not break nearly as easily as the stick will
    
 X 
|S|

| - stick
X - large sharp stone
S - string
        
        
        
        
harnass:
    - if you have a tamed animal you can put this on it
    - you can attach an animal to the plow with a harnass and then it'll take less energy/the animals energy
        - marking where to plow: (todo?)

        
        
- walking on plowed dirt has some chance of turning it back into regular dirt, isn't the case if you are sneaking
- one adaptation for the sisters or you is an adaption that lets them walk (or potentially even sprint at a later piont) at normal speed without damaging it
- weeds can potentially overwhelm crops so you need to do weeding, some sturdier crops you wouldn't need to worry about that
   - normally you'd have the sisters do this
   - the hoe is used for weeding faster instead of plowing

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
options to choose for sisters when emergeing from their young to adult form:
    - one of these two, one of these three, etc. so you could customize categories but you couldn't have someone that is good at everythig
    - one good early differentiations: you can pick 1 of these three:
        - (digger/build nest) something that is bonus to digging blocks away (even without tools, but also this is a bonus with tools)
        - (warrior) bonus to fighting without weapons and bonus while fighting with weapons 
        - (foragers) significantlty bigger inventory space
        
        
        
        
oak grass:
    - if too wet of a biome this might start to have mold problems, but as long as things aren't super wet and aren't too extreme, these can grow (grows in lots of places)
    - has tannins so you have to soak it to get tannins out which you can use for tanning hide to make leather
    - once you soak it you can grind it up into flour
    - because it has tannins you can store it for large amounts of time (similar to acorns irl)
 
    domesticated very early on
    
    

some largeish grass eating thing (mammal with beak) with usable wool and edible eggs would probably be domesticated early on
crocodogs would probably be domesticated fairly early on
giant aphids: same branch of tree of life of player species: size of rabbit, drills into bark of tree to drink tree sap, then secrets out honeydew like aphids do which then people can collect and be usable like honey
    ants domesticated aphids irl (for example)
    tree sap is crazy rich in sugar so if aphids can get the sugar then they need to secrete it so it doesn't completely overwhelm their sugar to water balance
    has specialized mouth stuff to work through tree bark
        [or maybe an arthiropod would make more sense, to be determined]
    player species can protect them, bring them to new trees, enemy colonies might try to raid and steal these
 
 
 

 
 
 
Something below the world:
    - maybe there would be a bedrock layer that is unbreakable but very difficult to break through, but there are some natural holes in it
    - one of those holes are volcanoes: full of lava
        If you swim down through the lava tube with magic or remove it carefully or something that lets you survive:
            bottom is eventually just lava going down forever
            inbetween bedrock and lava down forever:
                
    nothing sinks in lava: lava is dense enough that things will float in it (including you), it will take lots of energy to swim through thick gloopy lava
    islands of metal and crystal stuff that floats on the lava
    giant stalagmaties that hang from the bedrock
    
    nothing down there is edible, because they are all metalic or made of crystals too
        tend to have a ton of hit points and armor (not all hostile but might be some hostile ones) because made out of hefty materials
        plantlike things that can only grow in metal, if they are exposed to water they will rust, if they rust to much they will die
            you can get seeds for them and grow them on surface
            fruit that you can smelt down into ingots
        some metals and crystals that would only occur down there
        one specific idea:
            intelligent locals similar to zombie pigmen but more similar to villagers
                default neutral but can become hostile
                they have their own villages, something that looks vaugely otter like and can swim in the lava
                they are only scared of things that can swim in the lava so they are friendly to/maybe curious about player species
                you can drop items to them and they'll pick them up if it is something they'll want to trade for
                    - since you can't speak to them you have to:
                    - either if it is something they haven't seen they'll pick it up once, look at it and decide if they want it, then throw it back if they don't want it
                    - if they like it they'll trade with you
                    - make friends by giving them things that they like, then sometimes when you give them things they'll go and get an item and drop it for you
                    - things they like will be mostly things from the world above
                        things that are easy to get up above you might be able to trade with to get things that are difficult to get up above but easy to get below (such as tools to get out of tough materials, other things, etc.)
                    - metalic sounding squeaky otter noises
                    - villages and structures make buildings out of the logs and "trees" that grow down there
                        - relatively simple villages, occasional slightly larger but mostly fairly simple
                    - baby ones scamper around sometimes
            shark like things might swim in the lava
    glowy crystals
    orcha like things: killer wales
    - metal pill bug: crawls up on the shore to hide from spookers or can go in the lava
  
    things that look like ferns but made of crystals
    
    
    lava lillypad like things
        you can farm them but they only plant and spread in lava
        
        
        
        
        
    hydra, heads shoot lava, kill is to cut off all heads
